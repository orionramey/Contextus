## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through these documents, you will:

1. **Understand containerization** - Why Docker changes everything
2. **Master your development environment** - Terminal, Git, VS Code
3. **Learn infrastructure as code** - Configuration over clicks
4. **Practice troubleshooting** - Every error is a teacher

## 📖 How to Use These Docs

### For Beginners
1. Start with your platform's setup guide
2. Follow each step carefully - don't skip
3. When you hit an error, that's where learning happens
4. Use the troubleshooting sections before asking for help

### For Experienced Users
- Jump to specific sections as needed
- Contribute improvements via pull requests
- Share your optimizations in Discussions
- Help newcomers in Thursday gatherings

## 🔧 Document Structure

Each setup guide follows this pattern:
```
Prerequisites → Installation → Configuration → Verification → Troubleshooting
```

This mirrors real-world engineering workflows:
- **Plan** before you build
- **Implement** systematically
- **Test** everything
- **Debug** methodically

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Take Notes
Create your own `notes/` directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/DevOps/notes
echo "# My Engineering Journey" > ~/DevOps/notes/README.md
```

### Document Your Struggles
When something doesn't work:
1. Screenshot the error
2. Note what you tried
3. Document the solution
4. Share with the community

### Build Mental Models
Don't just copy commands. Understand:
- **What** each command does
- **Why** it's necessary
- **How** it connects to the bigger picture
- **When** you might need it again
