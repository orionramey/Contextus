- Choose a tech stack
- ex. Operatiing system -> Database --> Monitoring Stack --> containerization technique --> Automation Technique --> Change management 
- What I reccomend Linux[Ubuntu or Rhel] --> depends if you want to go opensource route or enterprise. Rhel is enterpise and devops and ubunto is open source and SecDevOps. --> Postgress[]setup a docker db container. Play around with mounts, you will determine what you need to learn based off of your own jearney once you spend the time mapping requirments and planning. It's a nonstop loop --> ELK[enterprise] or prometheous and grifanan for opensource --> Docker[enterprise] & Podman[Rhel Enterprise] & [k8s i honestly don't know?] Go with docker, docker desktop is super easy to work with and start messing with things. Way easier to digest and understand then reverse engineering in a scif to understand the workflow :|. Not like i have been there with docker.service or anyhting and fucking docker.socket --> Ansible[Enterprise] Jenkins[Enterprise] --> I reccoemnd the atlassian suite for all cases. Use confluence for your sops and sitemaps and knowledge hubs that will be built as you go. Watching some videos on jira and even building your own sandbox deployment through a simple stack like we are talking about would allow you to play around with creating epics, tasks, cms, you name it. This is the standard.

## After you chose the stack start building. 
Look on github, reddit, youtube, anywhere for any project that uses your stack that you can find passion in. This is something that I as a 4 time college drop out always struggled with. But it comes down to you must let your self experience grace, before life or anyone else will give it to you. I found my passion through this collimnation of failures, I am curious and cannot devout my life to a path. Through research I have found my thumos[excerpt defining the greek work thumos]. This greek word means to bring air to the blood. This is the ensuing passion that devours you after the devotion of curiosity.

- key notes networking i snot added becauses you will determine it as you go for each rpoprietary stack your team works with, its fluid  
Local stack for AI research consisting of: openai, atomicagents, and docker
